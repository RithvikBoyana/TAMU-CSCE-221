# TAMU CSCE 221 - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms assignments from Texas A&M University's CSCE 221 course.

## Assignments

### PA1 - Vector Implementation
- Implementation of a dynamic array (vector) data structure
- Features include dynamic resizing, iterator support, and various operations like push_back, pop_back, insert, and erase
- Includes comprehensive test suite for functionality verification

### PA2 - Sorting Algorithms
- Implementation of various sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Includes performance analysis and comparison of different sorting methods
- Features custom comparator support for flexible sorting

### PA3 - List and Queue Implementation
- Implementation of a doubly-linked list data structure
- Implementation of a queue using the list
- Features include iterator support, various insertion/deletion operations, and queue-specific operations
- Includes comprehensive test suite for both list and queue implementations

### PA4 - Binary Search Tree
- Implementation of a binary search tree data structure
- Features include insertion, deletion, searching, and various tree traversal methods
- Includes support for custom comparators and iterator implementation
- Comprehensive test suite for tree operations and properties

### PA5 - Unordered Map (Hash Table)
- Implementation of a hash table using separate chaining
- Features include:
  - Custom hash functions
  - Dynamic resizing
  - Iterator support
  - Various map operations (insert, erase, find)
- Includes comprehensive test suite for hash table operations

## Project Structure
Each assignment is contained in its own directory with the following structure:
- `src/` - Source code files
- `tests/` - Test files and testing framework
- `README.md` - Assignment-specific documentation
- `REPORT.md` - Implementation details and analysis

## Building and Testing
Each assignment includes its own Makefile for building and running tests. Refer to individual assignment READMEs for specific build instructions.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Make
- Google Test Framework (for testing)
