# TAMU CSCE 221 - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms assignments from Texas A&M University's CSCE 221 course during the Spring 2025 semester.

**NOTE:** This repository is meant to showcase my work and its sole purpose is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge gained from this course. **PLEASE REFRAIN FROM PLAGIARIZING/COPYING MY CODE.** Doing so will result in an honor violation at Texas A&M (refer to the Aggie Honor Code) and at almost any other institution or organization.

## Assignments

### PA1 - Vectors
- Implementation of a dynamic array (vector) data structure
- Features include dynamic resizing, iterator support, and various operations like push_back, pop_back, insert, and erase

### PA2 - Sorting Algorithms
- Implementation of various sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Includes performance analysis and comparison of different sorting methods
- Features custom comparator support for flexible sorting

### PA3 - Linked Lists and Queues
- Implementation of a doubly-linked list data structure
- Implementation of a queue using the list
- Features include iterator support, various insertion/deletion operations, and queue-specific operations

### PA4 - Binary Search Trees
- Implementation of a binary search tree data structure
- Features include insertion, deletion, searching, and various tree traversal methods
- Includes support for custom comparators and iterator implementation

### PA5 - Unordered Maps (Hash Tables)
- Implementation of an unordered map (hash table) using separate chaining (with linked lists)
- Features include:
  - Custom hash functions
  - Dynamic resizing
  - Iterator support (both global and bucket/local)
  - Various map operations (insert, erase, find)

## Project Structure
Each assignment is contained in its own directory with the following structure:
- `src/` - Source code files
- `tests/` - Test files and testing framework
- `README.md` - Documentation and guidelines to follow for each specific assignment
- `REPORT.md` - Implementation details and analysis

## Building and Testing
Each assignment includes its own Makefile for building and running tests. Refer to individual assignment READMEs for specific build instructions.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Make
- Google Test Framework (for testing)
